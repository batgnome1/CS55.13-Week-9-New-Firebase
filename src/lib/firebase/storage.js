/**
 * Firebase Storage Operations Module
 * 
 * This module provides functions for handling file uploads to Firebase Storage,

 * Key Features:
 * - Restaurant image uploads to Firebase Storage
 * - Automatic file path generation and organization
 * - Database reference updates after successful uploads
 * - Error handling and validation
